## Project Title

**SERIAL NUMBER EXTRACTOR FOR NIGERIAN CURRENCIES**

## Project Description

A method to identify fake cash has become necessary as a result of the large number of phony currency notes that have been created in recent years and the significant harm and cost they have brought to society. It was necessary to categories the notes and extract the serial numbers from them in order to address this issue. The serial number on the money was extracted using object character recognition that was optimized. To extract the serial numbers, Pytesseract, Easy OCR, and Keras OCR were utilized. Accuracy, Levenshtein Distance, Jaccard Similarity, Character Error Rate, and Damerau Distance are the metrics employed in this study. The dataset used in this research was gotten from Mendeley, Jide et al. generated the dataset that was utilized in this study (2021). There are 580 distinct banknote images in all. The result obtained in this research shows that EASYOCR had the best performance, with Accuracy (0.81), Levenshtein Distance (3.11), Jaccard Similarity (0.74), Character Error Rate (0.39) and Damerau Distance (0.74). KERASOCR achieved the next best results with Accuracy (0.60), Levenshtein Distance (3.35), Jaccard Similarity (0.23), Character Error Rate (0.79) and Damerau Distance (0.23). PYTESSERACT achieved the worst serial number extraction results in all metrics with Accuracy (0.38), Levenshtein Distance (5.96), Jaccard Similarity (0.23), Character Error Rate (0.79) and Damerau Distance (0.23) .In sum, this study, whose goal was to extract serial numbers from Nigerian banknotes, strongly suggests that the project's execution might be utilized to identify bogus naira notes in the nation. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the creation of a quick and effective banknote recognition system that makes use of images of banknotes and more precise point-of-care detection technologies for the identification and categorization of Nigerian banknotes.

## How to install and Run the Project

The program was run on Google colab (Ubuntu 20.04 OS)

## How to Use

You can edit the path variables existing thoughout the files to fit your file organization as many files are created and modified from this project. The entire project was run on google colab with storage on google drive. You can also run on your local instance but you would need a considerablea amount of resources as there are some resource-heavy computations present.
